## Disclaimer

This React App was not developed with the intention of being used as a boilerplate, but you can of course use the code however you want

## Tech

- React (create-react-app)
- React Router
- TypeScript

## Installation

Used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can pretty much use every `react-scripts` script

### `npm start` to run the project in your browser

### `npm run build` to build the app to the `build` folder
